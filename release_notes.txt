General
-------

Release 0.0.1 is a pre-alpha release to prototype the proposed DNP
Secure Authentication specification.

One of the design goals for this release is that the code should be as
OS independent as possible. Thus Qt4 was chosen as the GUI toolkit
and IP networking was chosen for the communications method. The core
DNP protocol code does not rely on Qt4 or have other OS dependencies.

DNP Support
-----------

UDP is the only networking currently supported and serial ports are
not yet supported. The DNP Master code is not fully subset level 1
compliant, yet supports subset level 1 objects and should be able to
communicate with a subset level 1 outstation. The DNP Outstation code
can simulate some very basic outstation responses.

Secure Authentication
---------------------

The basic features of secure authentication are demonstrated in this
working prototype. Aggressive mode and some timer related
functionality is not yet complete.
